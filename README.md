## Project Overview

The **HWS Robotics Club - 3rd Year Celebration** project is a Python-based GUI program created to celebrate and honor the members, faculty sponsors, and achievements of the HWS Robotics Club on its 3rd anniversary. It uses `tkinter` for the GUI, `Pillow` for handling images, and threading to manage animations. This interactive application is perfect for displaying at events or sharing within the community as a commemorative project.

## Features

- **Background Image**: A customizable background that visually enhances the experience.
- **Faculty & Member Recognition**: Sequentially displays faculty sponsors and all past and current members.
